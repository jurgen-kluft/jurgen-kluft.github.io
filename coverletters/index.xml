      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jurgen Kluft&#xA;Senior Software Engineer&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shanghai, 12/02/2020&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an enthousiast of technology and software development I was thrilled to hear that apart from the succesfull game PUBG you are also working on a new game and technology. I am confident I can help with working and improving the technology in many areas, from tools to runtime. I have worked on many engines, from UE3 to UE4 as well as many proprietary engines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
